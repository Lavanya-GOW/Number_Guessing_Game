# Number guessing game

A simple **Python terminal-based game** where the system generates a random number, and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

This is one of my early projects while learning python, helping me practice loops, conditionals, inputs and some logic.

## Features

- Random number generation
- Limited attempts for guessing
- Feedback after each guess (high/low/too high/too low/closely high/closely low)
- Option to play again
- Track of high score
